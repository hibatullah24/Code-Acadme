Student Performance Prediction
ðŸ“Š Dataset and Goal
This project uses the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains demographic, social, and academic information about Portuguese students. The goal of this analysis is to:

Recode the final grade (G3) into three categories: Low (0â€“9), Medium (10â€“14), and High (15â€“20)
Use Multinomial Logistic Regression to predict student performance categories
Explore data distributions, evaluate model accuracy, and interpret key predictors

ðŸš€ How to Run the Code
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.
Steps to run:
Clone this repository or download the notebook and dataset.
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
Run each cell step by step to:
Load and prepare the data
Fit the multinomial logistic regression model
Interpret results and visualize performance
The notebook includes all code, outputs, and interpretations for reproducibility.
